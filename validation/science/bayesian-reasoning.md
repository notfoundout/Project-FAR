# Validation — Bayesian Reasoning

## Purpose

This document evaluates Bayesian reasoning using the validation methodology defined by Project FAR.

The objective is to determine whether Bayesian reasoning can be represented using the Foundational Architecture of Reasoning Analysis (FARA), investigated using the Foundational Analysis of Reasoning (FAR), and analyzed using the Foundational Analysis of Reasoning Operations (FARO).

# 1. Framework

## Name

Bayesian Reasoning

---

## Purpose

To update degrees of belief in light of new evidence using probability theory.

---

## Domain

Statistics, artificial intelligence, decision theory, cognitive science, and scientific inference.

---

# 2. Structural Analysis

## Primitive Concepts

Examples include:

- Hypothesis
- Prior Probability
- Evidence
- Likelihood

The precise primitive concepts depend upon the Bayesian formulation employed.

---

## Derived Concepts

Examples include:

- Posterior Probability
- Bayesian Update
- Bayes Factor
- Predictive Distribution

---

## Architectural Structure

Bayesian reasoning organizes reasoning as successive probability updates performed in response to new evidence.

---

# 3. Reasoning Analysis

## Investigation

An investigation seeks to determine the probability of one or more hypotheses given available evidence.

---

## Representations

Hypotheses, probability distributions, observations, likelihoods, priors, posteriors, and probabilistic models.

---

## Interpretation

Meaning is assigned through probabilistic semantics and the interpretation of the underlying domain.

---

## Reasoning Calculus

The reasoning calculus consists of the rules of probability theory together with Bayesian updating.

---

## Reasoning States

Each probability update may be represented as a reasoning state.

---

## Transformations

Reasoning progresses through Bayesian updates that incorporate new evidence into existing probability distributions.

---

## Candidates

Competing hypotheses or probabilistic models admitted for consideration.

---

## Admissibility

Candidates are evaluated according to the selected probabilistic model, available evidence, and Bayesian reasoning calculus.

---

## Resolution

The investigation concludes by selecting the hypothesis or model favored according to the applicable resolution rule.

The resulting resolution remains subject to revision as additional evidence becomes available.

---

# 4. Mapping to FARA

Bayesian reasoning appears naturally representable within FARA.

Probability distributions, hypotheses, and evidence can all be represented explicitly as architectural components.

No significant incompatibilities have been identified.

---

# 5. Application of FAR

The FAR methodology can explicitly represent Bayesian investigations, including successive probability updates, evidence incorporation, and final resolution.

---

# 6. Application of FARO

Bayesian reasoning processes can be:

- compared,
- audited,
- and subjected to disagreement analysis

using the methods defined by FARO.

---

# 7. Evaluation

## Strengths

- Explicit representation of uncertainty.
- Naturally iterative.
- Well-defined update rules.
- Highly compatible with evidence-driven investigations.

---

## Limitations

Different prior probabilities may produce different reasoning processes despite identical evidence.

Practical implementations often rely on approximations.

---

## Open Questions

- How should uncertainty be represented most efficiently within reasoning states?
- Should probability distributions be treated as representations or properties of representations?
- Can Bayesian updates be represented independently of numerical probability?

---

# 8. Validation Summary

## Architecture Compatibility

**Full**

The architectural components of Bayesian reasoning appear representable within FARA.

---

## Methodology Compatibility

**Full**

The FAR methodology naturally accommodates iterative probability updates.

---

## Operational Compatibility

**Full**

Comparison, auditing, and disagreement analysis appear directly applicable.

---

## Overall Assessment

Bayesian reasoning appears fully compatible with the current architecture, methodology, and operational framework of Project FAR.

---

## Recommended Research

- Representation of probabilistic uncertainty.
- Validation against Bayesian networks.
- Comparison with non-Bayesian probabilistic reasoning.

---

# 9. Conclusion

Bayesian reasoning appears fully representable within the current scope of Project FAR.

Its explicit treatment of uncertainty provides an important validation of the framework beyond purely deductive and empirical reasoning.

# Project FAR governed registries

Status: **Canonical for the named registry function; never theory authority**

These machine-readable registries prevent research opportunities, unresolved questions,
citations, tool boundaries, known epistemic threats, and cross-chat planning state from
disappearing into transient conversation. They may route work and record provenance. They may
not alter a theorem, contract, proof, counterexample, or governance disposition.

`opportunities-v1.0.json` is the canonical planning inventory. Its `canonical` field means the
entry is a governed Project FAR planning record, not that the idea is part of canonical theory.
`SUPERSEDED` and `REJECTED` entries are permanent regression guards, not a backlog.

`project-memory-v1.0.json` is a compact governed planning-memory projection for cross-chat and
cross-agent continuity. It records the current epistemic calibration, claim-language guards,
product thesis, external-program prioritization, and reproducibility obligations without
becoming a second source of truth. Its own `canonical_resolution_rule` is binding for use of
that projection: current default-branch governance, theory, evidence ledgers, exact program
artifacts, and the canonical opportunity inventory override it on any conflict. Updating this
memory never changes EFR registration, theorem status, evidence class, or accepted research.

Generated human views are written under `docs/planning/` and `docs/research/`. Edit the governed
JSON source for the registry being changed and run its applicable validator/generator; do not
hand-edit a generated view.

Validation fails on duplicate identifiers, schema violations, unknown references, prohibited
ideas assigned an active priority, stale generated output, or a registry that attempts to
claim theory authority.
